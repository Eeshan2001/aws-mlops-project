# 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end MLOps deployment** of a Machine Learning application on AWS using modern DevOps practices.

The application predicts topics from user-provided text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The complete infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, containerized using **Docker**, deployed on **Amazon ECS Fargate**, exposed through an **Application Load Balancer**, monitored with **CloudWatch**, and integrated with **AWS CodePipeline** for CI/CD.

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

- Deploy a Machine Learning application on AWS
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform
- Deploy containers on Amazon ECS Fargate
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Integrate CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline
- Follow production-ready cloud architecture practices

# 🔐 Security Best Practices

- IAM Least Privilege
- Security Groups
- ECS Task Execution Role
- Private Amazon ECR Repository
- CloudWatch Centralized Logging
- Infrastructure managed with Terraform

---

# 💰 Cost Optimization

To minimize AWS costs for a personal account:

- ECS Fargate (single task)
- Public subnets (avoiding NAT Gateway charges)
- Small Fargate task size
- Application Load Balancer only
- Minimal CloudWatch retention
- No Auto Scaling enabled

---

# 📈 Future Enhancements

- HTTPS using ACM
- Route53 Custom Domain
- ECS Auto Scaling
- Blue/Green Deployment
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Amazon RDS
- Prometheus & Grafana
- GitHub Actions
- Automated Unit Tests
- Multi-Environment Deployment
